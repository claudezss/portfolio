GridOS-DERMS brings together the full breadth of Opus One’s innovations in model-based decision making,
real-time grid visibility, and distributed energy resource valuation.

Features include:

- Online power flow for full distribution visibility, based on breakthrough distribution system state estimation
- Direct DER monitoring, control, and dispatch or aggregator integration
- Optimization under two-way power flows, including VVO, CVR, and restoration capacity
- Constraint management using dynamic, nodal level, real-time, and forecasted hosting capacity
- Optimal asset utilization and grid benefits through locational marginal pricing of resources
- Day-ahead clearing and unit commitment, with hour- ahead and five-minute-ahead adjustments (based on security-constrained optimal power flow)
