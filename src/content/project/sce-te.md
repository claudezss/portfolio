[SCE Transactive Energy Management Software](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/07/23/2066619/0/en/Opus-One-Solutions-deploys-first-transactive-energy-management-software-at-Southern-California-Edison-for-a-DOE-demonstration-project.html)


This is the first transactive energy software deployment of its kind at Southern California Edison and in the
state of California. Opus One’s GridOS TEMS application will be used for SCE’s Electric 
Access System Enhancement (EASE) project, which is supported by the Department of Energy (DOE) Enabling Extreme
Real-time Grid Integration of Solar Energy (ENERGISE) program. The ENERGISE program is led by the DOE’s Solar Energy
Technologies Office, which aims to improve the affordability, reliability, and value of solar technologies on the grid.
